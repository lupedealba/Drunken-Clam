Then to open ROBO 3T I first had to open MONGO:
1. open 2 command prompt(the regular laptop one)
2. copy and paste the following on one of them:
    "C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\4.0\bin\mongod"
3. copy and paste the following on the second prompt,
(This one opens the shell so that i can edit my mongo throught their if i wanted):
    "C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\4.0\bin\mongo"
4. Then connect to the ROBO 3t:


figure out get route on server to be able to view my app locally with npm start.
I could use homework react examples.
Then keep editing the components



tonight ask Andy how do i get to view my edits locally. what am i missing.
ANSWER: Just get a separate client folder specifically for front end with a separate package.json

front end are gonna be in the client folder (public and src folder)

the rest is back end. so we dont need a server.js for the back end because we will be doing it through heroku.

so were going to make a plan with backend with Felipe's help. on how we should build the rest of the app, so
that we wont have to burn the whole app.

make plan
push into github and master
front end look
read me
what are Brandons merge conflicts?

PLAN
make a separate package json in client???
no

npm run client to start client from the parent

npm run dev to run the React app and Server at the same time with concurrently

so i installed concurrently with the command: npm install concurrently --save-dev

and i added on package.json:
"client": "cd client && npm start",
    "dev": "concurrently --kill-others-on-fail \"npm run start\" \"npm run client\""

so re install concurrently and then run:
npm run dev
